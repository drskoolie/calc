# Part I: How to Set Up

-> You need to have a virtual environment set up with all the required libraries

`python3 -m venv venv_calculator`

`source venv_calculator/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


The first command makes a virtual environment called `venv_calculator`. The second command activates it and the third command installs the required libraries
