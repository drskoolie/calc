# Welcome Agent Abdulla and Agent Sasharat

We have a critical issue, our latest microprocessor (Baraa-Master-Pro 5000) only has the following functions:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. If-Else Statements
4. For loops

We need these three functions to be implemented (using Test Driven Development!!!!) to make management happy:

1. Multiplication
2. Division (integer)
3. Quotient

`cd` in to the `docs/` folder and read the instructions given.

Sincerely,
DrSkoolie
